This exercise was created to explore ways of building a web site, from scratch, using a local JavaScript Object without any API's, libraries, or fancy frameworks. The challenge is to meant to challenge students and new developers by building a website only using a JavaScript, HTML Semantics, CSS, and a JavaScript object (similar to a JSON feed but local)

Future iterations will expand on the building a more complex JavaScript Object as well as creation of JavaScript Class using newer features of ECMAScript2015 and abvove

Note: All code in the main branch as well as the JSObjectToClass are my own.
Note: Any and all contributions are for extending this learning exercize through challenges or by offering alternative considerations for features of JavaScript.
